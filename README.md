Data from Public Records Act request for SFUSD resource alignment initiative (RAI) metrics

- [RAI_CPRA_response_july2024.zip](RAI_CPRA_response_july2024.zip) : Original files received from district
- [rai_combined.csv](rai_combined.csv) : Compilation of data in one file
- [rai_combined_fields.txt](rai_combined_fields.txt) : Data dictionary for CSV file above.

UPDATE (10/13/2024): For anyone attempting to reverse engineer the SFUSD composite scores, I recommend using the original files and NOT the rai_combined.csv dataset, as the latter made some assumptions in creating metrics that are not valid given additional information from SFUSD.


[Link to previous analysis](sfusd_rai_comments.html) based on older (non-current) data shared with the District Advisory committee, and older metric definitions from the RAI.
